# CPSC 349 - Fall 2022 - Exercise 4 - React and PocketBase

## What are we trying to accomplish?
In this exercise you will set up two additional components that are often essential to a fully-functioning web application:
* a back-end web service capable of storing data and authenticating users, and
* a client-side framework to simplify interaction between application code and the DOM.
In this exercise, you will install and configure PocketBase to act as a backend and esbuild to compile JSX for use with React.
